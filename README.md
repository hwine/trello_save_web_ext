# trello_save

**This add-on simplifies exporting a Trello Board's data as JSON**

This can be handy to have a local backup when there are problems with
the intertubes. I keep many to-do lists in Trello, and found the recent
inability to access them frustrating. Now I just click this whenever I
want a fresh local backup!

Note that Trello's mobile apps support offline work - this does not. It
is a read-only snapshot. There is no way to import this data.

## What it does

This extension will put a link labeled "JSON" next to the permission
level of the board (which is directly right of the board name). Right
click the link, and "Save link as" to backup the board.

The resultant json has no white space. If you need to view it, you
should have the json formatted. The easiest way is to open the JSON file
in Firefox.

## Thanks to Trello!

For including the [export
feature](http://help.trello.com/article/747-exporting-data-from-trello-1)
- I just found that UI too buried. They have some [good
  notes](http://help.trello.com/article/924-making-sense-of-trellos-json-export)
  on viewing the JSON as well.
