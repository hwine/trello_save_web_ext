# trello_export

**This add-on allows exporting a Trello Board's data as JSON**

This can be handy to have a local backup when there are problems with
the intertubes.

Note that Trello's mobile apps support offline work - this does not. It
is a read-only snapshot. There is no way to import this data.

## What it does

This extension will put a link labeled "JSON" next to the permission
level of the board. Right click the link, and "Save link as" to backup
the board.

The resultant json has no white space. If you need to view it, you
should have the json formatted. One way is to open the JSON file in
Firefox.
